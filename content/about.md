Hi there! Iâ€™m a (contract) Quantitative UX Researcher at [Scalence LLC](https://www.scalence.com), (supporting [Google AR/VR](https://arvr.google.com)) where I work on questions related to human-computer interaction (HCI) and human factors. Prior to joining Scalence, I interned at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio) as a UX Research Scientist Intern where I worked on [social connectedness in spatial audio calling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958824000848?via%3Dihub) and as UX Research Associate at [Blue Marble Health](https://bluemarblehealthco.com) where I assisted with reliability, validity, and usability of a remote therapeutic monitoring platform for chronic disease and aging.

I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology from UC Santa Cruz where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Jean E. Fox Tree](https://foxtree.sites.ucsc.edu). At UC Santa Cruz, I worked on questions related to person perception, metaperception, and computer-mediated communication. I'm also a first generation Mexican-American graduate (for PhD, MS, and BA).
