  Hi there! I’m a (contract) Quantitative UX Researcher at [Google XR](https://arvr.google.com) (via [BayOne Solutions]([https://www.scalence.com](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bayone-solutions/))) where I focus on questions related to human-computer interaction (HCI) and human factors/ergonomics. Prior to joining Google XR, I interned at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/facebook-reality-labs-research-future-of-audio) as a UX Research Scientist Intern, where I worked on [social connectedness in spatial audio calling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958824000848?via%3Dihub), and as a UX Researcher at [Blue Marble Health](https://bluemarblehealthco.com), where I assisted with reliability, validity, and usability of a remote therapeutic monitoring platform for chronic disease and aging.

  I have a PhD in Cognitive Psychology from UC Santa Cruz where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Jean E. Fox Tree](https://foxtree.sites.ucsc.edu) on questions surrounding computer-mediated communication, social presence, and interpersonal perception. I'm also a first generation Mexican-American college and graduate school grad! I'm happy to chat with other first-generation students of color on topics related to graduate school and/or transitioning from academia to industry ⭐️
