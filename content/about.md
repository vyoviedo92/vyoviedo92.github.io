Prior to becoming a graduate student, I completed my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology at California State University, Long Beach in 2014. Between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked for five years in the research field. I obtained my Masters of Science in Psychology from UC Santa Cruz in 2021.

My research primarily focuses on how perceptions of our conversational partners change when communicating across modalities, such as when using video-chat, messaging, and audio communication, as well as when modality switching, or switching between two communication media. I am also interested in how having diverse addressees affects our ability to communicate more effectively, as well as how prosody and intonational meaning affect perceptions and memory.
