Here's [my favorite song right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=br5W-G20v9k) and [what I'm currently watching](https://www.hbo.com/los-espookys)

Outside of academia, I enjoy going to live concerts, indoor rock climbing, and spending time with my cat, Luci. I also frequently travel to Guanajuato, Mexico where my family is from.
